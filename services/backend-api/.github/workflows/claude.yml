            Please review this pull request with a focus on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Security implications
            - Performance considerations

            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues.
            
            IMPORTANT: Only create a comprehensive test checklist if your verdict is "APPROVED" and the changes look good.
            
            If creating a checklist (only when approved):
            - Focus on the most critical and concise tests needed to validate the PR changes
            - Format the test checklist using GitHub markdown checkboxes (- [ ]) so the PR author can check them off
            - Add a note that all items should be checked before merging the PR
            
            If the PR has issues or needs changes, provide feedback through inline comments only, without creating a checklist.
